# Introduction to AI


## What is AI?


[Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) is the general name given to intelligence demonstrated by machines (software or hardware). This covers a lot of different areas and has broad-reaching applications. Typically when discussing AI in terms of data science, we're specifically interested in a subfield focused on learning. This is called [Machine Learning (ML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).


## Types of Machine Learning


There are many types of machine learning algorithms and each has a variety of applications. Here we have broken it down into 3 general subcategories: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning

### Unsupervised Learning


Unsupervised learning is used to extract patterns from data that might be difficult for a human to detect. Sometimes this is the end of the story (i.e. the pattern is your result) but you can also use unsupervised learning to identify key features in your data that can help you focus your analysis.


Example: Sorting things into categories (songs into genres, ice cream flavors you like/dislike)


### Supervised Learning


Supervised learning relies on data that has been labled such that a teacher can test the program on whether or not the input data is obtaining the desired output. Over many iterations and extensive training, the program can reach a state that it can produce the correct outputs on the training data and can be tested on previously unseen data.


Example: Teaching a child barnyard animals with a picture book


### Reinforcement Learning


Reinforcement learning involves building a set of rules that govern a system and a series of rewards/penalties for following/breaking those rules. In most cases, the program is described as an "agent" who navigates the system dynamically and attempts to obtain the maximum reward or minimum penalty.


Example: Learning to drive a car or play a game


### How ML works


So how does all of this actually work?

## Deep Learning


Deep learning (DL) is a sub-field of machine learning that uses models of human neurology to pass data and make decisions. Traditionally this is done using convolutional neural networks with several layers. Deep learning is a rapidly growing field and has applications from computer vision to drug design.
