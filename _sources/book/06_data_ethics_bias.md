Since the dawn of statistics in the 17th century statistics have been used used
to guide and mislead. Here we'll discuss a few of the ways issues can arise
when working with datasets.

- Garbage In, Garbage Out
  - No amount of statistical work can make up for unreliable or missing data.
  - Don't assume data independence.
- Tests are Imperfect
  - False negatives
  - False positives
- Pictures Can Be Deceiving

- *Cum Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc*
  - Correlation is when two variables move via some relationship
    - Positive correlation when they move in the same direction
    - Negative correlation when they move in opposite directions
    - Zero correlation, there is no relationship

- Statistical Measures Don't Tell the Whole Story
  - Look at the raw data
  - Data reduction (be wary of extrapolation)
- Sampling Bias
  - Non-response bias
  - Convenience or accidental sampling
- Context Matters
  - Statistics must be thought of in the wider context
