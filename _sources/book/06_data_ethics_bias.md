# Data Ethics and Bias

## *Hello World* Discussion

### Power

- What is an algorithm?
- Are algorithms given authority?
- Are algorithms used without knowing how they work?
- What does the middle ground look like between black box algorithms and having non at all?
- Do we have agency when using algorithms?
- Examples:
    - GPS
    - Budgeting tool
    - Stanislav Petrov
    - *Clinical versus Statistical Prediction*
    
### Data

- What are some long-term impacts of collecting personal data?
- Where is Eric Schmidt's "imaginary creepy line"?
- How can data be monetized?
- What are some benefits of personalized big data?
- What are some detriments of personalized big data?
- Why are Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome browsers free?
- Do we have data-collection agency?
- Examples:
    - Tesco
    - Target
    - Data brokers
    - Cambridge Analytica
    - Facebook manipulating mood
    - China's Social Credit System

Since the dawn of statistics in the 17th century statistics have been used used
to guide and mislead. Here we'll discuss a few of the ways issues can arise
when working with datasets.

- Garbage In, Garbage Out
  - No amount of statistical work can make up for unreliable or missing data.
  - Don't assume data independence.
- Tests are Imperfect
  - False negatives
  - False positives
- Pictures Can Be Deceiving

- *Cum Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc*
  - Correlation is when two variables move via some relationship
    - Positive correlation when they move in the same direction
    - Negative correlation when they move in opposite directions
    - Zero correlation, there is no relationship

- Statistical Measures Don't Tell the Whole Story
  - Look at the raw data
  - Data reduction (be wary of extrapolation)
- Sampling Bias
  - Non-response bias
  - Convenience or accidental sampling
- Context Matters
  - Statistics must be thought of in the wider context
