# The Pudding: Data Story Telling and Visualization

We'd like each of you to go to [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/) and read one of their data journalism pieces. We'll discuss each piece as a group afterwards.

Pay special attention to:
- Their Data
  - Where did their data come from?
  - Is the data public?
  - How big was the data? Did they use all of it?
- Their Analysis
  - What is their thesis statement?
  - What was their hypothesis?
  - What choices did they make as the analysis developed?
  - Were there caveats or ramifications to their choices?
  - What were their conclusions?
- Their Visualizations
  - What types of visualizations did they use?
  - Did the visualization help or hurt the arguments they made?
  - Was the visualization distracting or confusing?
  - Could you make a similar (if more simple) visualization?

Overall, did you think the article was interesting? Did having data to back up their thesis statement help make their argument?
