## Justice

- Would you rather have multiple choice questions (objective grades) or essay
  questions (subjective grades)?
- Do you think the US justice system has been historically fair or unfair accross all citizens?
- How would you judge the fictious case:
  > "An 18-year-old female defendant was apprehended for possession of
  > marijuana, arrested with her boyfriend and seven other acquaintances. There was
  > evidence of a substantial amount of smoked and un-smoked marijuana found, but
  > no marijuana was discovered directly on her person. She had no previous
  > criminal record, was a good student from a middle-class home and was neither
  > rebellious nor apologetic for her actions." -- Hannah Fry. "Hello World:
  > Being Human in the Age of Algorithms."
- Can historical data be used to predict future crimes?
- What do you think of the classifications of 'hobo', 'drunkard', 'ne're
  do-well', 'farm boy', and 'immigrant'?
- Do you think modern crimes fit historical crime patterns?
- What is the *random forests* method?
- What are some issues with predicting human behavior particularly as it applies to justice?

  the time of the crime?
- What are you thoughts on:
  > "The courts are concerned about not making mistakes – especially the judges
  > who are appointed by the public. The algorithm provides them a way to do less
  > work while not being accountable. -- Hannah Fry. "Hello World: Being Human
  > in the Age of Algorithms."
- Are algorithms based on historical data biased?
- What would you expect from an unbiased representation?
- Is there a moral responsibilty to not perpetuate historical injustices?
- What is the *anchoring effect*?
- What is Wber's Law?
- Examples
  - Richard Johnson and Nicholas Robinson
  - Ernest W. Burgess

## Medicine

- What is a pattern?
- What did Hippocrates do that was so profound?
- What do you think about the 15th century smallpox inoculations?
- Beyond a diagnosis, what can a physician provid to a patient?
- How do you know you are seeing a dog?
- What is a *neural network*?
- Is it easy to understand the internal workings of a trained neural network?
- Define *sensitivity* and *specificity*.
- How do *sensitivity* and *specificity* impact *false negatives* and *false
  positives*?
- What do you think about human/machine partnerships?
- How good was Dr. Snowden's prediction of Alzheimener's and what was the most
  telling signal in the dataset?
- What is the problem of over-diagnosis and over-treatment?
- What did a large dataset of biopsy slides and the associated patient outcomes
  discover?
- Why is algorithm medical diagnosis a hard problem?
- What are problems with medical data?
- How are your medical data and advertising data different?
- What was the outcome of the Google DeepMind and the Royal Free NHS Trust
  collaboration?
- Do you aggree or disagree with this sentiment:
  > "On the whole, people weren’t that worried about their data being hacked or
  > stolen. They were concerned about having assumptions made about them as a group
  > and then projected on to them as individuals." -- Hannah Fry. "Hello World:
  > Being Human in the Age of Algorithms."
- Should non-smokers be prioritized for medical care?
- How is the balance between privacy and benefits of shared data made?
- What do you think about 23andMe and similar companies?
  > "'The long game here is not to make money selling kits, although the kits
  > are essential to get the base level data.' Something worth remembering whenever
  > you send off for a commercial genetic report: you’re not using the product; you
  > are the product." -- Hannah Fry. "Hello World: Being Human in the Age of Algorithms."
- Should genetics be used for determing life insurance?
- What is the greatest good?
  > "If a diagnostic machine capable of recommending treatments can be built,
  > who should it serve? The individual or the population? Because there will be
  > times where it may have to choose." -- Hannah Fry. "Hello World: Being
  > Human in the Age of Algorithms."
