  > Being Human in the Age of Algorithms."
- Should non-smokers be prioritized for medical care?
- How is the balance between privacy and benefits of shared data made?
- What do you think about 23andMe and similar companies?
  > "'The long game here is not to make money selling kits, although the kits
  > are essential to get the base level data.' Something worth remembering whenever
  > you send off for a commercial genetic report: you’re not using the product; you
  > are the product." -- Hannah Fry. "Hello World: Being Human in the Age of Algorithms."
- Should genetics be used for determing life insurance?
- What is the greatest good?
  > "If a diagnostic machine capable of recommending treatments can be built,
