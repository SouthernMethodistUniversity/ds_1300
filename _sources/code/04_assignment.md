Generate a plot that you feel visualizes the data is an interesting way. Your plot should have the following elements:

>1) Title
>2) Legend
>3) Axes or other Labels
>4) Color
>5) 1 sentence description of what your plot shows
>6) Brief description of why you chose to make the plot the way you did.

You may use pandas, matplotlib, or seaborn.
