Students will be encouraged to use the course Slack channel for
communication with instructors and their fellow classmates. This will be
especially important when communicating with group members while working
on the semester project.

Class information and assignments will be posted in Canvas.

## Dates and Times

May Term, May 13 through 27  
9:30 AM - 12:00 PM, 1:00 PM - 3:00 PM

## Course Overview

We live in a world driven by computers, algorithms, and data. This
course seeks to equip students with the basic knowledge and skills to
not only understand but to use the tools needed to model and make
decisions about the world around them. Students will be introduced to
basic programming in Python, high-performance computing using ManeFrame
II, and data science. This course is not a programming course, though
programming will be required to complete assignments. Prior knowledge of
programming is neither expected nor required.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the course you will be able to:

-   Identify applications of data science in today’s world

-   Identify the privacy and ethical issues associated with the use of
    data

-   Clearly and concisely communicate data analyses via visualization
    and meaningful metrics

-   Have had exposure to computational thinking, programming, and
    high-performance computing

## University Requirement Fulfillment

### UC Requirement (matriculation Fall 2016 to Spring 2020)

This course meets a UC Breadth requirement for Technology and
Mathematics

1b  
Students will demonstrate an ability to analyze complex mathematical
problems that arise in a particular discipline or area

1c  
Students will demonstrate an understanding of how particular
technologies work

### CC Requirement (for students entering Fall 2020 or later)

This course fulfills the CC Breadth requirement for Technological
Advances and Society (TAS) by introducing students to the technology
used in computational and data sciences, how this technology affects
society by highlighting its use in different domains, and discussing
issues like privacy and ownership of information.

## Required Materials

For this course, you will need a computer that has internet access. All
programming will be done on through SMU’s OnDemand Portal so the
specifications of your machine are minimal as long as you can connect to
an internet browser.

The <u>required</u> reading for this class will be assigned out of:

-   [Hello World: Being Human in the Age of
    Algorithms](http://www.hannahfry.co.uk/books) by Hannah Fry

Suggested readings will come from an assortment of sources including:

-   [Introduction to Computation and Programming using
    Python](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-computation-and-programming-using-python-third-edition)
    by John V. Guttag

## Course Structure

This course will be lecture based with in-class activities designed to
demonstrate and reinforce concepts. Given the accelerated nature of
short semester courses, a given day will be divided into lecture, coding
demonstrations, hands-on programming exercises, and collaborative work
sessions. Students will be expected to complete homework assignments
after class, though these assignments will follow closely from what is
covered in class. Participation in class is expected and will be
critical to student success.

This course is not a programming course, though programming will be
required to complete assignments. Prior knowledge of programming is
neither expected nor required. The instructors will equip students with
the skills and tools needed to complete each assignment and be available
to provide programming support should need arise.

The course also contains a group project that will span the length of
the semester. Students will be divided into teams by the instructors.
These groups will work together for the duration of the semester. Group
work will be evaluated as a sum of individual efforts and, as such, each
member is expected to contribute equally to the success of the project.
Issues within teams should be brought to the instructors attention
immediately so they can be resolved quickly.

## Evaluation

In-class coding assignments, homework sets, and a semester-long group
project will be used to evaluate understanding and proficiency with the
material.

</div>

The semester project will culminate in a group presentation to the class
during the time designated by the University Registrar for the final
exam. This presentation will involve a question and answer session from
peer students, attendees, and the instructors. Students will be graded
on their presentation skills, content, ability to answer questions, and
engagement in other student presentations.

## Syllabus

Each calendar date on the syllabus corresponds to 4 lecture hours, in
line with the structure of a May Term semester.

### Semester-Long Project

Each student will be assigned a semester-long project that will require
the student to apply the methods and tools discussed in the class to a
unique dataset. The goal of the project is to reinforce core data
science concepts and techniques through application.

### University Policies

-   Disability Accommodations: Students needing academic accommodations
    for a disability must first register with Disability Accommodations
    & Success Strategies (DASS). Students can call 214- 768-1470 or
    visit: <http://www.smu.edu/Provost/ALEC/DASS> to begin the process.
    Once registered, students should then schedule an appointment with
    the professor as early in the semester as possible, present a DASS
    Accommodation Letter, and make appropriate arrangements. Please note
    that accommodations are not retroactive and require advance notice
    to implement.

-   Religious Observance: Religiously observant students wishing to be
    absent on holidays that require missing class should notify their
    professors in writing at the beginning of the semester, and should
    discuss with them, in advance, acceptable ways of making up any work
    missed because of the absence. (See University Policy No. 1.9.)

-   Excused Absences for University Extracurricular Activities: Students
    participating in an officially sanctioned, scheduled University
    extracurricular activity should be given the opportunity to make up
    class assignments or other graded assignments missed as a result of
    their participation. It is the responsibility of the student to make
    arrangements with the instructor prior to any missed scheduled
    examination or other missed assignment for making up the work.

-   Student Learning Outcomes: Please include in your syllabi all
    student learning outcomes, both those specific to your course, as
    well as those that satisfy major and general education requirements.

-   Final Exams: Final course examinations shall be given in all courses
    where they are appropriate, and some form of final assessment is
    essential. Final exams or final assessments must be administered as
    specified in the official examination schedule, and shall not be
    administered during the last week of classes or during the Reading
    Period. Please state clearly in the syllabus the date/time and form
